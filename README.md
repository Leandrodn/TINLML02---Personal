# TINLML02---Personal
## Personal Assignment 1
* Four implementations can be found in the folder 'Opdracht1'
* Each of these implementations cover different goals of the assigment.
* 'neural_net_LinksAndNodes' covers the object oriented implementation of a neural net.
* 'neural_net_Matrix' covers the implementation using matrices and vector.
* 'neural_net_Numpy' corvers the matrix implementation but using Numpy instead of selfmade functions
* 'neural_net_HiddenLayer' covers a numpy implementation but with a hidden layer between the input and output nodes

## Personal Assignment 2
* The folder 'Opdracht2' contains four files:
* 'GeneticAlgo_LeandroDeNijs_1003440' is the main implementation of the genetic algoritm. It covers all the goals as stated in the assignment.
* 'Chords' is a python class to make the chord objects.
* 'Muser' is an library provided by J. de Hooge to make the '.wav' files from tuples. Code is altered to allow for three layers (chords) instead of two.

##Personal Assignment Extra
* The folder 'Extra opdracht' contains two files:
* 'LinearRegression_Extra_LeandroDeNijs_1003440' is the implementation of the extra assigment.
* 'data.pkl' is the saved data dynamically generated by the webpage. Data is saved to remove the need of scraped the page each time. If this file does not exist, data is scraped from the webpage.
